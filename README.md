> This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

Display tables and charts based on data from [https://exchangeratesapi.io/](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).

I didn't use any state manager because it's a small application, and the only shared state fits perfectly on a simple service.
